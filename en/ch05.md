The `Receive` tab provides tools for generating subaddresses.

(1) **Addresses:** This list includes your wallet's primary address (starting with 4...) and all its subaddresses (starting with 8...).  
(2) **Create new address:** This button allows you to create as many new subaddresses as you wish. Since Monero is private, you don't need to create a new subaddress every time you receive a transaction. However, to avoid off-chain linking, it's recommended that you create a new subaddress for every person, company or exchange you will receive Monero from. *Learn more about [subaddresses](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3673/what-is-a-sub-address).*
